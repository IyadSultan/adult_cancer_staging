# Cancer Staging Report

**Date of Extraction:** 2025-03-10

## Understanding Cancer Staging Terminology

This report uses the following terms for cancer staging:

- **TNM Values**: The raw TNM classification notation (T=Tumor size/extent, N=Node involvement, M=Metastasis) directly extracted from the medical note. Prefixes like 'c' indicate clinical staging, 'p' indicates pathologic staging.

- **Extracted Stage**: The exact staging information as written in the original medical note, representing how the healthcare provider documented the stage.

- **AI Stage Determination**: The system's interpretation based on AJCC 8th Edition guidelines, consisting of:
  - **Clinical Stage**: Full stage interpretation including TNM values and formal stage grouping based on examinations and imaging
  - **Pathologic Stage**: Stage determination based on surgical/pathological findings (when available)

## Patient Information and Staging Results

### Medical Note: hn_example.txt

**Disease:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx

**Category:** Laryngeal Carcinoma

**System:** AJCC8 system

**TNM Values:** cT2N0M0

**Extracted Stage:** cT2N0M0

**AI Stage Determination:**

- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)
- Pathologic Stage: Insufficient information

**Detailed Explanation:**

The clinical staging of the patient was determined using the AJCC 8th Edition criteria for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx, specifically focusing on the TNM classification. 

1. **Primary Tumor (T)**: The flexible laryngoscopy revealed a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. This categorizes the tumor as cT2 because it is greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 4 cm in greatest dimension and involves the vocal cord mobility.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The imaging studies indicated multiple small lymph nodes in levels II and III with no definitive evidence of metastatic involvement, therefore classified as cN0, indicating no evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M)**: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of distant metastatic disease, resulting in a classification of cM0.

Combining these findings, the clinical stage is classified as cT2N0M0, which corresponds to Stage II for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis).

For the **pathologic stage**, pathology reports have confirmed a diagnosis of well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma but do not yet provide specific pT or pN classifications because the patient has not undergone therapeutic surgical intervention. Therefore, we cannot definitively assign a pathologic stage at this time, leading us to categorize the information available as "Insufficient information."

In summary, the clinical stage is determined with confidence based on the findings, while the pathologic stage remains undetermined pending further surgical evaluation.

# Cancer Staging Report

**Patient Information**:  
- Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Category: Laryngeal Carcinoma)  
- Date of Report: [Insert Date]  
- Physician: [Insert Physician’s Name]  
- Medical Record Number: [Insert MRN]  

## Summary of the Case
The patient presents with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx confirmed through flexible laryngoscopy and histopathological analysis. The tumor is located on the right true vocal cord, demonstrating a certain size and characteristics that will inform both clinical and future pathologic staging.

## TNM Classification
### Clinical Staging
- **Primary Tumor (T)**: cT2  
  - Basis: A flexible laryngoscopy revealed a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord which extends to the anterior commissure and is associated with impaired vocal cord mobility. This qualifies the tumor as T2 according to AJCC 8th Edition (tumor size > 2 cm but ≤ 4 cm).
  
- **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: cN0  
  - Basis: Imaging illustrated multiple small right level II and III lymph nodes (largest 0.8 cm) without definitive radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement, thus classified as N0.

- **Distant Metastasis (M)**: cM0  
  - Basis: CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed no evidence of distant metastatic disease.

### Clinical Stage Summary
- **Clinical Stage**: cT2N0M0, which corresponds to **Stage II** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis).

### Pathologic Staging
- **Primary Tumor (pT)**: Not determined (pending surgery).  
  - Basis: Histopathology confirms well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord, but pT classification requires surgical intervention for confirmation.

- **Regional Lymph Nodes (pN)**: Not determined (insufficient data).  
  - Basis: The absence of lymphovascular invasion noted in the biopsy does not allow for definitive pN classification as node involvement post-surgery is still pending.

- **Distant Metastasis (pM)**: Not determinate (no available pathologic data).  
  - Basis: Distant metastatic findings will require evaluation following potential surgical interventions.

### Pathologic Stage Summary
- **Pathologic Stage**: Insufficient information to assign a pathologic stage at this time.

## Key Findings that Determined the Stage
1. The tumor size (2.5 cm) and characteristics (exophytic) established the cT2 classification.
2. Imaging studies confirmed absence of regional lymph node involvement (cN0).
3. CT scans demonstrated no evidence of distant metastasis (cM0).

## Important Prognostic Factors
- Histology indicates the tumor is well to moderately differentiated, correlating with a potentially favorable prognosis. The absence of lymphovascular invasion also supports a less aggressive behavior of the tumor.

## Limitations or Uncertainties in the Staging Determination
- The pathologic stage remains undetermined due to pending surgical intervention, which is necessary to accurately assess pT, pN, and observe any potential pM involvement. The staging report is thus limited to the clinical parameters evaluated.

This comprehensive evaluation integrates clinical criteria and outlines the status of the patient’s squamous cell carcinoma to facilitate informed clinical decision-making as the patient moves forward with treatment planning.

**Recommendations**: Consider surgical intervention for definitive pathologic staging and management of the identified laryngeal carcinoma. Further imaging may also be required to monitor for any changes in lymphatic involvement or distant metastasis.

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and mild dysphagia.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presented with persistent hoarseness and mild dysphagia over the past 3 months. He has also noted a slight sensation of a lump in the throat and occasional pain radiating to the right ear. Initial laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal cord lesion with visible extension to the anterior commissure. Patient was subsequently referred for further imaging and biopsy.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
- HEENT: No facial asymmetry, no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy
- Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. No extension to the supraglottis or subglottis was observed. Left vocal cord appears normal with full mobility.

**Radiology Summary:**  
- CT neck with contrast: 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure. The lesion does not appear to invade through the thyroid cartilage. No evidence of extralaryngeal spread. 
- Multiple small (largest 0.8 cm) right level II and III lymph nodes noted, none with definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Pathology Summary:**  
- Direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of the right vocal cord lesion performed 1 week ago.
- Histopathology reveals well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord.
- No lymphovascular invasion identified in the biopsy specimen.

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- LDH: Normal range

**Staging Assessment:**  
- Primary Tumor (T): Clinical T2 – Tumor involving right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to anterior commissure, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
- Regional Lymph Nodes (N): Clinical N0 – No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
- Distant Metastasis (M): Clinical M0 – No evidence of distant metastasis.
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)

**Treatment Discussion:**  
The case was discussed at the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The patient's Stage II laryngeal cancer has two potential standard-of-care treatment options:
1. Radiation therapy alone: 66-70 Gy over 6-7 weeks
2. Conservative partial laryngectomy (cordectomy/hemilaryngectomy)

Both options offer similar oncologic outcomes with reported 5-year locoregional control rates of 85-90%. The primary difference is in functional outcomes and quality of life considerations.

**Treatment Recommendation:**  
After discussion with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of each approach, the patient has elected to proceed with definitive radiation therapy to maximize voice preservation. 

**Plan:**  
1. Radiation Oncology consultation to be completed today for planning of definitive radiation therapy.
2. Speech therapy evaluation pre-treatment and follow-up during/after radiation.
3. Nutrition consult for prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement consideration.
4. Smoking cessation program reinforcement.
5. Follow-up laryngoscopy 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
6. Consider PET/CT 3 months post-treatment to assess response.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment, T2N0M0 glottic laryngeal cancer has a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80-85%.
