# Adult Cancer Staging Project Status

## Completed Steps
- Created adult cancer staging module with CrewAI agents using Azure OpenAI
- Converted the codebase to use Azure OpenAI API instead of OpenAI API
- Added Azure OpenAI configuration module
- Updated agents to use Azure OpenAI LLM
- Added LangChain integration for Azure OpenAI
- Fixed model format to use the required LiteLLM format "azure/{deployment_name}"
- Implemented proper environment variable configuration for LiteLLM
- Updated README with Azure OpenAI instructions and provider flexibility guidance

## Current Status
- The staging module has been updated to use Azure OpenAI API 
- Models now use the LiteLLM required format: "azure/{deployment_name}"
- The code uses both the LangChain Azure OpenAI integration and the CrewAI/LiteLLM integration
- Environment variables have been updated to match LiteLLM's expectations
- The code now uses environment variables from .env file for Azure configuration:
  - AZURE_API_KEY
  - AZURE_API_BASE (for LiteLLM)
  - AZURE_API_VERSION
  - AZURE_GPT4O_DEPLOYMENT
- Detailed debug logging has been added for Azure OpenAI configuration
- The existing functionality has been maintained with Azure OpenAI as the backend
- Documentation has been updated to explain how to switch between different model providers

## Next Steps
- Test the Azure OpenAI integration
- Process medical notes with the updated module
- Evaluate staging accuracy with clinical experts
- Extend the module to handle more complex medical notes
- Improve error handling and robustness
- Consider implementing adapter pattern for easier switching between LLM providers
