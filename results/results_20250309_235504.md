## Patient Information and Staging Results

### Medical Note: hn_example.txt

**Disease:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx

**Category:** Laryngeal Carcinoma

**System:** AJCC8 system

**TNM Values:** cT2N0M0

**Extracted Stage:** cT2N0M0

**AI Stage Determination:**

- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)
- Pathologic Stage: Insufficient information

**Detailed Explanation:**

The clinical stage has been determined based on the AJCC 8th Edition staging criteria for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx. The criteria are evaluated as follows:

1. **Primary Tumor (T):** The patient presents with a clinical classification of T2. The medical note indicates that there is a 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure, which results in impaired vocal cord mobility. Importantly, there is no invasion through the thyroid cartilage noted, confirming the T2 categorization.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):** The clinical assessment shows N0 as there is no radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis. This is supported by the CT findings, which indicate multiple small right level II and III lymph nodes without definite evidence of metastatic involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):** The patient is classified as M0 since there is no evidence of distant metastasis following the imaging studies of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Combining these evaluations leads to the clinical stage designation of cT2N0M0, corresponding to Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis).

On the other hand, the pathologic stage is marked as "Insufficient information" because the medical note provides details primarily about the clinical staging and does not include definitive pathologic data to classify tumor (pT) or lymph node involvement (pN). A pathology report confirming any invasion, thyroid cartilage involvement, or any positive lymph nodes post-surgical intervention would be necessary to assign a pathologic stage. Currently, the histopathology summary mentions "well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma" but lacks specific details regarding pathologic staging or lymphovascular invasion necessary for a comprehensive assessment.

Therefore, while the clinical staging is clear and well-defined, the pathologic stage remains undetermined until further information is acquired post-treatment.

### 1. Case Summary
The patient presents with a Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx, specifically involving the right true vocal cord. Clinical evaluation has determined the extent of the tumor and its regional lymphatic involvement as well as the absence of distant metastasis, leading to the classification of the cancer stage.

### 2. TNM Classification
**Clinical Classification (c):**
- **T (Primary Tumor):** cT2  
- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes):** cN0  
- **M (Distant Metastasis):** cM0  

**Pathologic Classification (p):**  
- **Pathologic T:** Insufficient information available  
- **Pathologic N:** Insufficient information available  
- **Pathologic M:** Insufficient information available  

### 3. Overall Stage
**Clinical Stage:** cT2N0M0  
**Stage Grouping:** Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)  
**Pathologic Stage:** Insufficient information

### 4. Key Findings that Determined the Stage
- **T Category:**  
  - Clinical assessment classified the T category as T2. The medical documentation reports a 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord that extends to the anterior commissure while noting no invasion through the thyroid cartilage.
  
- **N Category:**  
  - Classified as N0 based on the absence of radiographic evidence for regional lymph node metastasis. CT imaging specifically ruled out definitive metastasis to nearby lymph nodes.
  
- **M Category:**  
  - Classified as M0, supported by comprehensive imaging studies showing no signs of distant metastasis in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis.

### 5. Important Prognostic Factors
- The tumor's differentiation is noted to be "well to moderately differentiated," which is generally associated with a better prognosis.
- The absence of lymph node involvement (N0) and distant metastasis (M0) contributes positively to the patient’s overall prognosis.

### 6. Limitations or Uncertainties in Staging Determination
- The pathologic staging is currently marked as "Insufficient information." This is due to the lack of definitive pathologic data regarding the tumor characteristics (pT) and any assessment of regional lymph nodes (pN). Detailed pathology reports post-surgical intervention will be necessary to fully characterize the disease and assign a definitive pathologic stage. 

**Recommendation:** Continuous follow-up is vital post-treatment, including surgical pathology assessment, to ensure a complete understanding of potential stage changes based on tissue evaluation.

### Multidisciplinary Conference (MDC) Note

**Patient:**  
- Name: [Patient Name]  
- Age: 62 years  
- Gender: Male  
- Medical Record Number: A654321
- Smoking History: 40 pack-years, quit 2 years ago
- Alcohol History: Moderate alcohol use (2-3 drinks per day for 25 years)

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Attendees:**  
- Head and Neck Surgical Oncologist
- Radiation Oncologist  
- Medical Oncologist  
- Neuroradiologist  
- Pathologist  
- Speech-Language Pathologist
- Oncology Nurse Navigator

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and mild dysphagia.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presented with persistent hoarseness and mild dysphagia over the past 3 months. He has also noted a slight sensation of a lump in the throat and occasional pain radiating to the right ear. Initial laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal cord lesion with visible extension to the anterior commissure. Patient was subsequently referred for further imaging and biopsy.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
- HEENT: No facial asymmetry, no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy
- Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. No extension to the supraglottis or subglottis was observed. Left vocal cord appears normal with full mobility.

**Radiology Summary:**  
- CT neck with contrast: 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure. The lesion does not appear to invade through the thyroid cartilage. No evidence of extralaryngeal spread. 
- Multiple small (largest 0.8 cm) right level II and III lymph nodes noted, none with definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Pathology Summary:**  
- Direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of the right vocal cord lesion performed 1 week ago.
- Histopathology reveals well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord.
- No lymphovascular invasion identified in the biopsy specimen.

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- LDH: Normal range

**Staging Assessment:**  
- Primary Tumor (T): Clinical T2 – Tumor involving right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to anterior commissure, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
- Regional Lymph Nodes (N): Clinical N0 – No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
- Distant Metastasis (M): Clinical M0 – No evidence of distant metastasis.
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)

**Treatment Discussion:**  
The case was discussed at the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The patient's Stage II laryngeal cancer has two potential standard-of-care treatment options:
1. Radiation therapy alone: 66-70 Gy over 6-7 weeks
2. Conservative partial laryngectomy (cordectomy/hemilaryngectomy)

Both options offer similar oncologic outcomes with reported 5-year locoregional control rates of 85-90%. The primary difference is in functional outcomes and quality of life considerations.

**Treatment Recommendation:**  
After discussion with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of each approach, the patient has elected to proceed with definitive radiation therapy to maximize voice preservation. 

**Plan:**  
1. Radiation Oncology consultation to be completed today for planning of definitive radiation therapy.
2. Speech therapy evaluation pre-treatment and follow-up during/after radiation.
3. Nutrition consult for prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement consideration.
4. Smoking cessation program reinforcement.
5. Follow-up laryngoscopy 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
6. Consider PET/CT 3 months post-treatment to assess response.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment, T2N0M0 glottic laryngeal cancer has a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80-85%.
