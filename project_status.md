# Pediatric Cancer Staging Project Status

## Completed Steps
- Created project structure and files
- Implemented CrewAI agents for cancer identification and staging
- Set up Toronto staging module workflow
- Added support for processing medical notes
- Implemented CSV output for results
- Created a fixed version of the Toronto staging data with proper JSON structure
- Added robust error handling for JSON parsing issues
- Added fallback mechanism in case of staging data loading issues
- Created a simplified run_example.py script for easy testing
- Provided instructions for running and testing the module
- Fixed and expanded the staging data to include all cancer types
- Updated the module to handle both original and fixed staging data
- Added comprehensive documentation for all supported cancer types

## Current Status
- Successfully tested the module on example medical notes
- The project is complete and ready for testing with medical notes
- The staging module is configured to use the OpenAI gpt-4o-mini model
- Fixed JSON handling issues to ensure proper loading of the staging data
- The module now supports all cancer types from the Toronto staging system
- The simplified run_example.py script can be used to test the module with either original or fixed staging data

## Next Steps
- Test with additional medical note samples for different cancer types
- Evaluate staging accuracy with clinical experts
- Improve error handling and robustness
- Extend to handle more complex medical notes
- Add support for batch processing of multiple medical notes
- Consider creating a simple web interface for easier interaction
