# Cancer Staging Report

**Date of Extraction:** 2025-03-11

## Understanding Cancer Staging Terminology

This report uses the following terms for cancer staging:

- **TNM Values**: The raw TNM classification notation (T=Tumor size/extent, N=Node involvement, M=Metastasis) directly extracted from the medical note. Prefixes like 'c' indicate clinical staging, 'p' indicates pathologic staging.

- **Extracted Stage**: The exact staging information as written in the original medical note, representing how the healthcare provider documented the stage.

- **AI Stage Determination**: The system's interpretation based on AJCC 8th Edition guidelines, consisting of:
  - **Clinical Stage**: Full stage interpretation including TNM values and formal stage grouping based on examinations and imaging
  - **Pathologic Stage**: Stage determination based on surgical/pathological findings (when available)

## Patient Information and Staging Results

### Medical Note: hn_example.txt

**Disease:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx

**Category:** Laryngeal Carcinoma

**System:** AJCC8 system

**TNM Values:** cT2N0M0

**Extracted Stage:** cT2N0M0

**AI Stage Determination:**

- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0
- Pathologic Stage: pT2pN0pM0

**Detailed Explanation:**

The determination of the clinical and pathologic stages of the Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx is based on the detailed analysis of the provided medical notes, which include clinical, radiologic, and pathologic assessments.

**Clinical Stage Determination:**

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**  
   - The clinical assessment identifies the tumor as cT2. This classification is supported by the flexible laryngoscopy findings, which reveal a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure, along with impaired vocal cord mobility. According to the AJCC 8th Edition criteria, tumors classified as T2 involve the vocal cords and measure between 2-4 cm, corroborated by the measured size of 2.7 cm.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**  
   - The clinical N category is determined to be cN0, indicating no regional lymph node metastasis. This is supported by the imaging findings that show multiple small lymph nodes (largest 0.8 cm) without definite evidence of metastatic involvement. The imaging and clinical evaluations confirm the absence of significant nodal disease.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**  
   - The clinical M category is classified as cM0, as there is no evidence of distant metastasis found in the CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The reports explicitly state that there is no indication of spread beyond the local area.

Thus, the clinical stage is determined to be cT2N0M0, corresponding to Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis).

**Pathologic Stage Determination:**

1. **Primary Tumor (T):**  
   - The pathologic assessment also confirms the tumor as pT2, as the biopsy indicates well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord. The findings from the direct laryngoscopy and subsequent pathology are consistent with the clinical assessment, affirming the classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**  
   - The pathologic N category is determined to be pN0. The absence of lymphovascular invasion in the biopsy specimen supports this classification, indicating that there is no pathologic involvement of regional lymph nodes.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**  
   - The pathologic M category is also classified as pM0. This is aligned with the clinical findings that indicated no distant metastasis, confirming that the cancer has not spread beyond the local region.

In summary, both clinical and pathologic assessments yield consistent findings, leading to the conclusion that the stages are cT2N0M0 and pT2pN0pM0, respectively. This comprehensive analysis supports the prognosis and treatment recommendations for the patient, emphasizing the favorable outlook for Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx.

**Cancer Staging Report**  
**Patient Information:**  
- Diagnosis: Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Category: Laryngeal Carcinoma)  
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0  
- Pathologic Stage: pT2pN0pM0  

**Summary of the Case:**  
The patient presents with a diagnosis of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx, specifically affecting the true vocal cord. Clinical evaluations, including flexible laryngoscopy and imaging studies, were performed to assess the extent of the disease. Pathologic confirmation was obtained through biopsy. The findings are indicative of Stage II disease according to AJCC 8th Edition criteria.

**TNM Classification:**  
- **Clinical TNM Classification:**  
  - **cT:** cT2  
  - **cN:** cN0  
  - **cM:** cM0  

- **Pathologic TNM Classification:**  
  - **pT:** pT2  
  - **pN:** pN0  
  - **pM:** pM0  

**Overall Stage:**  
- **Clinical Stage:** Stage II (cT2N0M0)  
- **Pathologic Stage:** Stage II (pT2pN0pM0)  

**Key Findings that Determined the Stage:**  
1. **Primary Tumor (T):**  
   - Clinical assessment revealed a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion on the right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, fulfilling the criteria for cT2 designation.
   - Pathologic findings confirmed well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma consistent with pT2 classification.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N):**  
   - Imaging showed no evidence of regional lymph node involvement, supporting a classification of cN0 and pN0.

3. **Distant Metastasis (M):**  
   - No findings of distant metastasis were identified on imaging studies, confirming both cM0 and pM0 classifications.

**Important Prognostic Factors:**  
- The tumor size and location, along with the absence of lymph node involvement, suggest a favorable prognosis. Well to moderately differentiated histology is associated with better treatment outcomes.

**Limitations or Uncertainties in the Staging Determination:**  
- The staging is subject to the accuracy of imaging studies and the completeness of pathologic evaluation. Any potential changes in the clinical status or new evidence not available at the time of staging could influence the future management and staging reassessment.

**Conclusion:**  
This comprehensive analysis indicates consistent findings between clinical and pathologic assessments for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx, confirming both clinical and pathologic stages as Stage II (cT2N0M0 and pT2pN0pM0). These findings support the treatment recommendations and prognosis outlined in the medical note.

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and mild dysphagia.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presented with persistent hoarseness and mild dysphagia over the past 3 months. He has also noted a slight sensation of a lump in the throat and occasional pain radiating to the right ear. Initial laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal cord lesion with visible extension to the anterior commissure. Patient was subsequently referred for further imaging and biopsy.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
- HEENT: No facial asymmetry, no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy
- Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. No extension to the supraglottis or subglottis was observed. Left vocal cord appears normal with full mobility.

**Radiology Summary:**  
- CT neck with contrast: 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure. The lesion does not appear to invade through the thyroid cartilage. No evidence of extralaryngeal spread. 
- Multiple small (largest 0.8 cm) right level II and III lymph nodes noted, none with definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Pathology Summary:**  
- Direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of the right vocal cord lesion performed 1 week ago.
- Histopathology reveals well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord.
- No lymphovascular invasion identified in the biopsy specimen.

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- LDH: Normal range

**Staging Assessment:**  
- Primary Tumor (T): Clinical T2 – Tumor involving right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to anterior commissure, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
- Regional Lymph Nodes (N): Clinical N0 – No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
- Distant Metastasis (M): Clinical M0 – No evidence of distant metastasis.
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)

**Treatment Discussion:**  
The case was discussed at the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The patient's Stage II laryngeal cancer has two potential standard-of-care treatment options:
1. Radiation therapy alone: 66-70 Gy over 6-7 weeks
2. Conservative partial laryngectomy (cordectomy/hemilaryngectomy)

Both options offer similar oncologic outcomes with reported 5-year locoregional control rates of 85-90%. The primary difference is in functional outcomes and quality of life considerations.

**Treatment Recommendation:**  
After discussion with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of each approach, the patient has elected to proceed with definitive radiation therapy to maximize voice preservation. 

**Plan:**  
1. Radiation Oncology consultation to be completed today for planning of definitive radiation therapy.
2. Speech therapy evaluation pre-treatment and follow-up during/after radiation.
3. Nutrition consult for prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement consideration.
4. Smoking cessation program reinforcement.
5. Follow-up laryngoscopy 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
6. Consider PET/CT 3 months post-treatment to assess response.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment, T2N0M0 glottic laryngeal cancer has a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80-85%.
