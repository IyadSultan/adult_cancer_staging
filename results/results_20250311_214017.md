# Cancer Staging Report

**Date of Extraction:** 2025-03-11

## Understanding Cancer Staging Terminology

This report uses the following terms for cancer staging:

- **TNM Values**: The raw TNM classification notation (T=Tumor size/extent, N=Node involvement, M=Metastasis) directly extracted from the medical note. Prefixes like 'c' indicate clinical staging, 'p' indicates pathologic staging.

- **Extracted Stage**: The exact staging information as written in the original medical note, representing how the healthcare provider documented the stage.

- **AI Stage Determination**: The system's interpretation based on AJCC 8th Edition guidelines, consisting of:
  - **Clinical Stage**: Full stage interpretation including TNM values and formal stage grouping based on examinations and imaging
  - **Pathologic Stage**: Stage determination based on surgical/pathological findings (when available)

**Category:** Laryngeal Carcinoma

**TNM Values:** cT2N0M0

**Extracted Stage:** cT2N0M0

- Pathologic Stage: Not determined

**Detailed Explanation:**



**Staging Report:**

**Cancer Staging Report**  
**Patient Information:**  
- Age: [Non-identifying age]  
- Gender: [Non-identifying gender]  
- Date of Report: [Current date]  
- Medical Record Number: [Non-identifying record number]  

**Diagnosis:**  
Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Right True Vocal Cord (Category: Laryngeal Carcinoma)  

**TNM Classification:**  
- **Clinical Classification:**  
  - **cT2:** Tumor is 2.7 cm, involving the right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to the anterior commissure.  
  - **cN0:** No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.  
  - **cM0:** No evidence of distant metastatic disease.  

**Overall Clinical Stage:**  
- **Stage II** (cT2N0M0)  

**Key Findings that Determined the Stage:**  
1. **Primary Tumor (T) Category:**  
   - The tumor size measuring approximately 2.7 cm and its involvement with the anterior commissure supports the classification as T2, as it is greater than 2 cm but less than 4 cm. The impairment of vocal cord mobility is indicative of significant local invasion.  
   - Supporting Evidence: "Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility."  

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (N) Category:**  
   - The absence of radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis confirms N0 status, despite the presence of small lymph nodes which are not indicative of metastatic disease.  
   - Supporting Evidence: "No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis."  

3. **Distant Metastasis (M) Category:**  
   - The CT scan findings indicating no evidence of distant metastatic disease affirm the M0 classification.  
   - Supporting Evidence: "CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease."  

**Important Prognostic Factors:**  
- Histopathology shows well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which generally indicates a more favorable prognosis.  
- No lymphovascular invasion was identified in the biopsy specimen, suggesting a lower risk of metastasis and potentially a better prognosis.  

**Limitations or Uncertainties in the Staging Determination:**  
- The clinical stage has not been confirmed pathologically due to the absence of definitive pathologic staging information at this time.  
- Continuous monitoring and further evaluation may be necessary to ensure that the cancer has not progressed, particularly in regard to any potential future lymph node involvement.

This staging report provides a comprehensive overview of the patient's squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord, incorporating all relevant clinical and pathologic findings according to the AJCC 8th Edition criteria. Further management should be guided by these findings, along with ongoing clinical evaluation.

### Multidisciplinary Conference (MDC) Note

**Patient:**  
- Name: [Patient Name]  
- Age: 62 years  
- Gender: Male  
- Medical Record Number: A654321
- Smoking History: 40 pack-years, quit 2 years ago
- Alcohol History: Moderate alcohol use (2-3 drinks per day for 25 years)

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Attendees:**  
- Head and Neck Surgical Oncologist
- Radiation Oncologist  
- Medical Oncologist  
- Neuroradiologist  
- Pathologist  
- Speech-Language Pathologist
- Oncology Nurse Navigator

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and mild dysphagia.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presented with persistent hoarseness and mild dysphagia over the past 3 months. He has also noted a slight sensation of a lump in the throat and occasional pain radiating to the right ear. Initial laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal cord lesion with visible extension to the anterior commissure. Patient was subsequently referred for further imaging and biopsy.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
- HEENT: No facial asymmetry, no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy
- Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. No extension to the supraglottis or subglottis was observed. Left vocal cord appears normal with full mobility.

**Radiology Summary:**  
- CT neck with contrast: 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure. The lesion does not appear to invade through the thyroid cartilage. No evidence of extralaryngeal spread. 
- Multiple small (largest 0.8 cm) right level II and III lymph nodes noted, none with definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Pathology Summary:**  
- Direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of the right vocal cord lesion performed 1 week ago.
- Histopathology reveals well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord.
- No lymphovascular invasion identified in the biopsy specimen.

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- LDH: Normal range

**Staging Assessment:**  
- Primary Tumor (T): Clinical T2 – Tumor involving right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to anterior commissure, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
- Regional Lymph Nodes (N): Clinical N0 – No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
- Distant Metastasis (M): Clinical M0 – No evidence of distant metastasis.
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)

**Treatment Discussion:**  
The case was discussed at the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The patient's Stage II laryngeal cancer has two potential standard-of-care treatment options:
1. Radiation therapy alone: 66-70 Gy over 6-7 weeks
2. Conservative partial laryngectomy (cordectomy/hemilaryngectomy)

Both options offer similar oncologic outcomes with reported 5-year locoregional control rates of 85-90%. The primary difference is in functional outcomes and quality of life considerations.

**Treatment Recommendation:**  
After discussion with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of each approach, the patient has elected to proceed with definitive radiation therapy to maximize voice preservation. 

**Plan:**  
1. Radiation Oncology consultation to be completed today for planning of definitive radiation therapy.
2. Speech therapy evaluation pre-treatment and follow-up during/after radiation.
3. Nutrition consult for prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement consideration.
4. Smoking cessation program reinforcement.
5. Follow-up laryngoscopy 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
6. Consider PET/CT 3 months post-treatment to assess response.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment, T2N0M0 glottic laryngeal cancer has a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80-85%.
