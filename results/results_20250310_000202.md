## Understanding Cancer Staging Terminology

This report uses the following terms for cancer staging:

- **TNM Values**: The raw TNM classification notation (T=Tumor size/extent, N=Node involvement, M=Metastasis) directly extracted from the medical note. Prefixes like 'c' indicate clinical staging, 'p' indicates pathologic staging.

- **Extracted Stage**: The exact staging information as written in the original medical note, representing how the healthcare provider documented the stage.

- **AI Stage Determination**: The system's interpretation based on AJCC 8th Edition guidelines, consisting of:
  - **Clinical Stage**: Full stage interpretation including TNM values and formal stage grouping based on examinations and imaging
  - **Pathologic Stage**: Stage determination based on surgical/pathological findings (when available)

## Patient Information and Staging Results

### Medical Note: hn_example.txt

**Disease:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx

**Category:** Laryngeal Carcinoma

**System:** AJCC8 system

**TNM Values:** cT2N0M0

**Extracted Stage:** cT2N0M0

**AI Stage Determination:**

- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)
- Pathologic Stage: Insufficient information

**Detailed Explanation:**

**Clinical Stage Determination:**  
- **Primary Tumor (T)**: The lesion is classified as cT2 because it involves the right true vocal cord and extends to the anterior commissure, measuring 2.7 cm. According to AJCC criteria, T2 is defined for tumors that are larger than 1 cm but less than or equal to 3 cm in greatest dimension, with involvement of the vocal cord(s) but no extension to the supraglottis or subglottis.
  
- **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**: The classification is cN0 due to the absence of clinically evident lymph node metastasis. Imaging demonstrated multiple small right level II and III lymph nodes but none exhibited definite evidence of metastasis. Therefore, N0 is appropriate.
  
- **Distant Metastasis (M)**: Classified as cM0 as the imaging studies show no evidence of distant metastasis.

Combining these findings aligns with the AJCC 8th Edition staging categories: cT2N0M0 results in a Stage II designation for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx.

**Pathologic Stage Determination:**  
Currently, the patient has not undergone surgical treatment, thus no pathologic staging can be established at this time. Pathology findings from surgical intervention will be necessary to classify pT, pN, and pM stages definitively. 

- The biopsy shows well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which is relevant but not conclusive for staging until surgical management occurs and further pathology assessments can be made.  
- No lymphovascular invasion was observed in the biopsy specimen, which supports the expectation of pN0 if lymph nodes are untouched.

In conclusion, the clinical stage is well defined as cT2N0M0, while the pathologic stage remains insufficient until post-treatment pathological evaluations are completed.

**Cancer Staging Report**

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Category: Laryngeal Carcinoma)  
- **TNM Classification:** cT2N0M0  

---

**1. Brief Summary of the Case:**  
This report details the clinical staging for a patient diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx, specifically involving the right true vocal cord with impaired mobility and extending towards the anterior commissure. The patient has not yet undergone surgical intervention, thus the pathologic stage is currently insufficient for determination.

---

**2. TNM Classification:**  
- **Clinical T (cT):**  
   - **Category:** cT2  
   - **Evidence:** Clinical T2 classification is supported by imaging findings indicating a tumor measuring approximately 2.7 cm on the right true vocal cord, extending to the anterior commissure. The involvement of vocal cords but without extension to supraglottic or subglottic regions adheres to AJCC criteria for T2.

- **Clinical N (cN):**  
   - **Category:** cN0  
   - **Evidence:** Multiple small right level II and III lymph nodes were identified, with the largest measuring 0.8 cm and none showing definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement leading to the classification of N0.

- **Clinical M (cM):**  
   - **Category:** cM0  
   - **Evidence:** Imaging (CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis) reveals no evidence of distant metastatic disease, confirming classification as M0.

---

**3. Overall Stage:**  
- **Clinical Stage:**  
   - cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis).

---

**4. Key Findings that Determined the Stage:**  
- The primary tumor's involvement of the vocal cord and direct measurement correspond to the criteria for T2 classification.  
- Absence of regional lymph node metastasis correlates with the cN0 classification.  
- Imaging confirms no distant metastasis, leading to the cM0 determination.  
Therefore, these findings collectively define the clinical stage as Stage II.

---

**5. Important Prognostic Factors:**  
- **Smoking History:** The patient has a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years, which is a recognized risk factor potentially impacting prognosis and treatment decisions.  
- **Alcohol Use:** Moderate alcohol consumption noted, adding another layer to the risk profile.

---

**6. Limitations or Uncertainties in Staging Determination:**  
- The pathologic stage remains unestablished at present, pending surgical intervention and subsequent pathology assessments post-treatment. The current classification is subject to change based on surgical findings and histological evaluation. As such, definitive pT, pN, and pM classifications are pending.  
- The biopsy indicated well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, a finding relevant for prognosis but not sufficient alone for staging until definitive measures are undertaken.

---

**Conclusion:**  
The clinical assessment for this patient indicates a staging of cT2N0M0, corresponding to Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx. Further pathologic evaluation post-surgery will be necessary for a complete staging framework.

### Multidisciplinary Conference (MDC) Note

**Patient:**  
- Name: [Patient Name]  
- Age: 62 years  
- Gender: Male  
- Medical Record Number: A654321
- Smoking History: 40 pack-years, quit 2 years ago
- Alcohol History: Moderate alcohol use (2-3 drinks per day for 25 years)

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and mild dysphagia.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presented with persistent hoarseness and mild dysphagia over the past 3 months. He has also noted a slight sensation of a lump in the throat and occasional pain radiating to the right ear. Initial laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal cord lesion with visible extension to the anterior commissure. Patient was subsequently referred for further imaging and biopsy.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
- HEENT: No facial asymmetry, no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy
- Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. No extension to the supraglottis or subglottis was observed. Left vocal cord appears normal with full mobility.

**Radiology Summary:**  
- CT neck with contrast: 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure. The lesion does not appear to invade through the thyroid cartilage. No evidence of extralaryngeal spread. 
- Multiple small (largest 0.8 cm) right level II and III lymph nodes noted, none with definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Pathology Summary:**  
- Direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of the right vocal cord lesion performed 1 week ago.
- Histopathology reveals well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord.
- No lymphovascular invasion identified in the biopsy specimen.

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- LDH: Normal range

**Staging Assessment:**  
- Primary Tumor (T): Clinical T2 – Tumor involving right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to anterior commissure, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
- Regional Lymph Nodes (N): Clinical N0 – No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
- Distant Metastasis (M): Clinical M0 – No evidence of distant metastasis.
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)

**Treatment Discussion:**  
The case was discussed at the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The patient's Stage II laryngeal cancer has two potential standard-of-care treatment options:
1. Radiation therapy alone: 66-70 Gy over 6-7 weeks
2. Conservative partial laryngectomy (cordectomy/hemilaryngectomy)

Both options offer similar oncologic outcomes with reported 5-year locoregional control rates of 85-90%. The primary difference is in functional outcomes and quality of life considerations.

**Treatment Recommendation:**  
After discussion with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of each approach, the patient has elected to proceed with definitive radiation therapy to maximize voice preservation. 

**Plan:**  
1. Radiation Oncology consultation to be completed today for planning of definitive radiation therapy.
2. Speech therapy evaluation pre-treatment and follow-up during/after radiation.
3. Nutrition consult for prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement consideration.
4. Smoking cessation program reinforcement.
5. Follow-up laryngoscopy 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
6. Consider PET/CT 3 months post-treatment to assess response.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment, T2N0M0 glottic laryngeal cancer has a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80-85%.
