## Understanding Cancer Staging Terminology

This report uses the following terms for cancer staging:

- **TNM Values**: The raw TNM classification notation (T=Tumor size/extent, N=Node involvement, M=Metastasis) directly extracted from the medical note. Prefixes like 'c' indicate clinical staging, 'p' indicates pathologic staging.

- **Extracted Stage**: The exact staging information as written in the original medical note, representing how the healthcare provider documented the stage.

- **AI Stage Determination**: The system's interpretation based on AJCC 8th Edition guidelines, consisting of:
  - **Clinical Stage**: Full stage interpretation including TNM values and formal stage grouping based on examinations and imaging
  - **Pathologic Stage**: Stage determination based on surgical/pathological findings (when available)

## Patient Information and Staging Results

### Medical Note: hn_example.txt

**Disease:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx

**Category:** Laryngeal Carcinoma

**System:** AJCC8 system

**TNM Values:** cT2N0M0

**Extracted Stage:** cT2N0M0

**AI Stage Determination:**

- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)
- Pathologic Stage: Insufficient information

**Detailed Explanation:**

The clinical staging of the patient has been thoroughly assessed based on the AJCC 8th Edition criteria for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx. The primary tumor (T) is classified as cT2 because the lesion is reported as a 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord with impaired mobility and extending to the anterior commissure, which fits the criteria of being greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 4 cm. The absence of any lymph node metastasis is indicated by the cN0 classification, as there is no radiographic evidence of regional lymph node involvement, despite small lymph nodes being noted. Finally, the classification for distant metastasis is cM0, confirming that there is no evidence of distant metastatic disease.

The pathologic staging is marked as insufficient information since there has been no surgical intervention performed yet to fully assess the tumor's characteristics, particularly the histopathologic features related to lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. The biopsy results confirm the presence of well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, but without further surgical pathology, a definitive pathologic stage cannot be assigned.

In summary, the clinical stage assessment is robust and well-supported by the clinical findings, while the pathologic stage remains undetermined at this time due to the lack of surgical evaluation.

**Patient Information:**  
- **Diagnosis:** Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Category: Laryngeal Carcinoma)  
- **Date of Report:** [Insert Date]  
- **Prepared By:** [Insert Name/Title]  

**Summary of the Case:**  
This report documents the clinical staging of a patient diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx. The tumor is located on the right true vocal cord, exhibiting impaired mobility and extending to the anterior commissure. Comprehensive imaging studies have indicated no evidence of regional or distant metastasis. Pathologic evaluations are pending due to the absence of surgical intervention.

**TNM Classification:**  
- **Clinical Classification:**  
  - **T (Primary Tumor):** cT2  
  - **N (Regional Lymph Nodes):** cN0  
  - **M (Distant Metastasis):** cM0  

**Overall Stage:**  
- **Clinical Stage:** Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)  

**Key Findings Determining the Stage:**  
1. **Primary Tumor (cT2):**  
   - The tumor measures approximately 2.7 cm and involves the right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to the anterior commissure. This meets the criteria for cT2 as defined by AJCC, being greater than 2 cm but less than or equal to 4 cm.

2. **Regional Lymph Nodes (cN0):**  
   - No evidence of regional lymph node metastasis was observed. Imaging findings indicate multiple small lymph nodes, but none show definite signs of metastatic involvement.

3. **Distant Metastasis (cM0):**  
   - Comprehensive imaging (CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis) shows no evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Important Prognostic Factors:**  
- The patient has a significant smoking history of 40 pack-years and reported alcohol use, which may influence treatment options and overall prognosis.

**Limitations or Uncertainties in Staging Determination:**  
- The pathologic stage is marked as insufficient information due to the lack of surgical intervention to assess histopathologic features fully. While the biopsy confirms well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, definitive evaluations concerning lymph node involvement and distant metastasis cannot be established without additional surgical pathology.

**Conclusion:**  
The clinical stage of the patient is assessed as cT2N0M0, corresponding to Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis). Further evaluation is warranted following surgical intervention to determine the pathologic stage and to guide treatment decisions.

### Multidisciplinary Conference (MDC) Note

**Patient:**  
- Name: [Patient Name]  
- Age: 62 years  
- Gender: Male  
- Medical Record Number: A654321
- Smoking History: 40 pack-years, quit 2 years ago
- Alcohol History: Moderate alcohol use (2-3 drinks per day for 25 years)

**Date:** [Current Date]

**Attendees:**  
- Head and Neck Surgical Oncologist
- Radiation Oncologist  
- Medical Oncologist  
- Neuroradiologist  
- Pathologist  
- Speech-Language Pathologist
- Oncology Nurse Navigator

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with 3-month history of progressive hoarseness and mild dysphagia.

**Clinical Summary:**  
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a significant smoking history who presented with persistent hoarseness and mild dysphagia over the past 3 months. He has also noted a slight sensation of a lump in the throat and occasional pain radiating to the right ear. Initial laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal cord lesion with visible extension to the anterior commissure. Patient was subsequently referred for further imaging and biopsy.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital Signs: Within normal limits
- General: Alert, oriented, in no acute distress
- HEENT: No facial asymmetry, no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy
- Flexible laryngoscopy shows a 2.5 cm exophytic lesion of the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure with impaired vocal cord mobility. No extension to the supraglottis or subglottis was observed. Left vocal cord appears normal with full mobility.

**Radiology Summary:**  
- CT neck with contrast: 2.7 cm mass involving the right true vocal cord extending to the anterior commissure. The lesion does not appear to invade through the thyroid cartilage. No evidence of extralaryngeal spread. 
- Multiple small (largest 0.8 cm) right level II and III lymph nodes noted, none with definite radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement.
- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: No evidence of distant metastatic disease.

**Pathology Summary:**  
- Direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of the right vocal cord lesion performed 1 week ago.
- Histopathology reveals well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the right true vocal cord.
- No lymphovascular invasion identified in the biopsy specimen.

**Laboratory Findings:**  
- CBC: Within normal limits
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- LDH: Normal range

**Staging Assessment:**  
- Primary Tumor (T): Clinical T2 – Tumor involving right true vocal cord with impaired mobility, extending to anterior commissure, measuring approximately 2.7 cm.
- Regional Lymph Nodes (N): Clinical N0 – No radiographic evidence of regional lymph node metastasis.
- Distant Metastasis (M): Clinical M0 – No evidence of distant metastasis.
- Clinical Stage: cT2N0M0, Stage II Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Larynx (Glottis)

**Treatment Discussion:**  
The case was discussed at the Head and Neck Multidisciplinary Tumor Board. The patient's Stage II laryngeal cancer has two potential standard-of-care treatment options:
1. Radiation therapy alone: 66-70 Gy over 6-7 weeks
2. Conservative partial laryngectomy (cordectomy/hemilaryngectomy)

Both options offer similar oncologic outcomes with reported 5-year locoregional control rates of 85-90%. The primary difference is in functional outcomes and quality of life considerations.

**Treatment Recommendation:**  
After discussion with the patient regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes of each approach, the patient has elected to proceed with definitive radiation therapy to maximize voice preservation. 

**Plan:**  
1. Radiation Oncology consultation to be completed today for planning of definitive radiation therapy.
2. Speech therapy evaluation pre-treatment and follow-up during/after radiation.
3. Nutrition consult for prophylactic gastrostomy tube placement consideration.
4. Smoking cessation program reinforcement.
5. Follow-up laryngoscopy 8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
6. Consider PET/CT 3 months post-treatment to assess response.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment, T2N0M0 glottic laryngeal cancer has a favorable prognosis with 5-year overall survival rates of approximately 80-85%.
